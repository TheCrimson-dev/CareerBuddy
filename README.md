# CareerBuddy
This is a mobile app created for iOS. This app is geared towards keeping track of the jobs you applied for. A user can add, archive or delete job postings they have created to keep track of their applications. Each job posting has fields that can be filled out and the user can change the status of each one that will be categorized into its own entity.
